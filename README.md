# OOP_Email_Reader_and_Filer
This was my first attempt at creating something with OOP.  
It is a simple program that would allow one to read and file emails. 

The script uses the OS module and I/O to a text file to store information about the user when  
the email account is initially set up. The script is able to check for this file.  
If it exists it knows the account has already been create, gets the user information from the text  
file and skips the "Welcome to your new mailbox" messages and mail box setup. 

The file uses dummy email data in the script to show how it could work. 

This task allowed me to practise my OOP with Python and also incorporate, reading and writing data to   
files in Python.
